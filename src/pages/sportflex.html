              Sportflex is a place for fitness, where young people can connect with friends. This
              idea was brought to me by my brother who participated in Hack The Crisis: Youth
              Hackathon with his teammates and won the 2nd price. My job for this project was to
              design a fun and simple look for this app.

          <h4>Problem statement</h4>
          <p>
            Working out is a social activity, but due to the current situation in the world, it is
            not possible. We want to ease the problem of not being able to do sports together or in
            the way we're used to. The app simplifies the social experience of sport.

            <h4>User persona</h4>
            <p>
              To get a clear overview of the target user I created a persona based on my findings to
              effectively represent their needs and characteristics of them. I continuously placed
              myself in Kelly's "shoes" to empathize with her throughout the design process.

          <h4>Lo-fi wireframes & research</h4>
          <p>
            After reading through my brothers findings I started creating wireframes to cover my
            users needs.<br />
            During the research phase, the Hackathon team send out a link to their social media
            friends and asked “How many squats can you do compared to me?” In just about an hour
            over 50 people answered. In addition, one of the teammate’s videos called his friends
            and challenged them to do a squats competition, which everyone accepted.
