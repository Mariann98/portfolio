              Gift from afar is one of my projects for the University course Bespoke Design. The
              purpose of this was to design a digital gift-giving experience for people living far
              away from friends and family tuned to the personality, interests, and needs of a
              specific user.

            <h4>Problem statement</h4>
            <p>
              Foreign college students like myself are separated from their loved ones and this can
              be hard especially during special occasions, like birthdays. I want to create a fun
              digital gift-giving experience to help the giver and receiver build a deeper
              connection with each other and make the distance between them easier.

            <h4>User persona</h4>
            <p>
              To get a clear overview of the target user I created a persona based on my findings to
              effectively represent their needs and characteristics of them. I continuously placed
              myself in Maya's "shoes" to empathize with her throughout the design process.

            <h4>The story of gift-giving</h4>
            <p>
              It’s Maya’s 20th birthday, and she receives a message from her sister. Maya downloads
              and opens the Gift from Afar app to see further instructions.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="work_wrapper_right">

        <div class="work_wrapper_reverse">
          <div class="work_wrapper_left">
            <p>
              After scanning her ticket by the enterence she heads straight to the Goliath line and
              follows the guidelines and taps on the rocket. Maya is a bit confused after reading
              there will be another gift for her since she thought the present was the ticket to the
              theme park.
            </p>

          <div class="work_wrapper_right">

              A screen appears welcoming her. She gets magic mittens from the instructor and puts
              them on. Then she waits a few minutes till the music starts playing and the ride
              starts. The rollercoaster takes off, Maya’s anticipation builds up as she gets her
              first command to look to her left to catch a doughnut. She sees the doughnut and
              sticks her hand to the left to touch the hologram. She touches the hologram doughnut
              with her mittens resulting in her feeling a buzz. She gets thrilled as she gets the
              taste of what she can expect. The app congratulates her on her good job.
            </p>

              As the roller coaster speeds up, Maya sees the message telling her to enjoy the ride.
              She gets an adrenaline rush all over her body as the Goliath goes down at a fast
              speed. Another screen comes up telling her to put her hands up to catch a cookie. Maya
              puts her hands up and is ready to touch the next hologram. She misses it but has the
              opportunity to catch it again. 3... 2... 1... she touches it and can feel the buzz
              again in her mittens! This continues a few times over till all 10 elements have
              passed. As the ride ends, Maya is sad because the fun part is over.

          <div class="work_wrapper_left">
            <p>
              The screen turns festive and congratulates Maya on her achievement. She totally forgot
              about the actual gift that her sister got her and is extremely surprised. Maya opens
              it immediately and sees a ticket appear. It's an invitation to her favourite local
              restaurant in the Netherlands, and her sister will be there with her next week. Maya’s
              eyes tear up because she is happy to receive such a thoughtful gift as well that her
              sister will be coming to visit her.

            <p>
              As Maya is walking home, she wants to have another look at the gift. She opens the app
              and finds out that the gift can be saved in a digital toaster which makes her smile.
              Maya notices another function and taps on it. Pictures of her catching the snacks
              appear and she starts laughing. She downloads the photos and sends them to her sister
              thanking her for the experience.
