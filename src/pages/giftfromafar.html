              Gift from afar is one of my projects for the University course Bespoke Design. The
              purpose of this was to design a digital gift-giving experience for people living far
              away from friends and family tuned to the personality, interests, and needs of a
              specific user. This project was made in teams of two.

            <h4>Step 1 Research set-up</h4>
            <p>
              In week 1 I had to meet with my user and have an unofficial meeting in order to get to
              know one another. This followed with coming up with research questions, set-up, and
              techniques. In week 2 I conducted a semi-structured interview, shadowing, and a
              collage according to my research set-up.
              <!-- Afterward, to get a clear overview of the
              target user I created a persona based on my findings to effectively represent their
              needs and characteristics of them. I continuously placed myself in Maya's "shoes" to
              empathize with her throughout the design process.-->

              In week 2 I gathered all the data I got from my research techniques and made a table
              overview of them. Afterward, I placed them on Miro to create clusters and insights.

            <h4>Step 3 Surprise for the User</h4>
            <p>
              Week 3 aligned with the Dutch traditional Sinterklaas day, therefore I had to make a
              'surprise' for my user. Sinterklaas gifts are to be creatively disguised and are
              usually accompanied by a humorous poem that has something to do with the character or
              a characteristic of the receiver. I had to get my user a present that she would like
              and pack it in a cool way that would represent her characteristics. During my research
              I found out that she loves food and especially Nutella and is passionate about
              photography, I got a good sense of what to make for her.

            <h4>Step 4 Persona and Design Vision</h4>
            <p>
              In week 4, my partner and I had to combine our User Portraits into one Persona and
              come up with a design vision.<br />
              Maya is a traveling soul since she has had the opportunity to explore new countries
              and has also lived in a few of them throughout the years. She loves to be surrounded
              by her friends and family despite being introverted. Her passions are photography,
              gaming, and eating together with her loved ones which is a nice way for them to bond
              with each other. Because of her constant moving, she often gets separated from her
              friends and needs to find new alternatives to connect with them and have some quality
              time together. <br />
              <br />

              <i>Explanation for the intangible gift:</i> The user loves food and thinks it is one
              of the best presents especially when it is for free. Also,this way the user can have
              some quality time with her sister which she really appreciates.<br />
              <br /><i>Gift:</i> invitation to user's favorite restaurant <br /><br /><i
                >Gift-giver:</i
              >
              Sister<br />
              <br /><i>Occasion:</i> Birthday Show of caring: puts effort into the wrapping by
              creating an interesting and emotional experience. <br /><br />
            </p>
            <p>
              Design direction:<b> A meaningful real-life imitation of gift-giving </b><br />The
              experience we want the user to have should imitate the feeling she has with her loved
              ones, but remotely from wherever she is. We want her to have a surprise moment when
              receiving the present, giving her a sense of recognition from others reaching out to
              her. Maya is a person who loves to keep meaningful gifts in a box/on the wall, so
              there should be a possibility to preserve those significant gifts in a cool way
              online.

            <p>
              In weeks 6 and 7, my team had to come up with HMW questions and use them to conduct
              testing by using creative techniques. We chose Worst idea, Brainwrite, and Dot voting
              methods. Afterward, we had to do braindump ourselves by coming up each with 40 ideas
              and then sketching 20 of them. This followed with paper prototypes, and three draft
              concepts per team member.

            <h4>The story of gift-giving</h4>
            <p>
              It’s Maya’s 20th birthday, and she receives a message from her sister. Maya downloads
              and opens the Gift from Afar app to see further instructions.
            </p>

          <div class="work_wrapper_left">
            <p>
              After scanning her ticket by the enterence she heads straight to the Goliath line and
              follows the guidelines and taps on the rocket. Maya is a bit confused after reading
              there will be another gift for her since she thought the present was the ticket to the
              theme park.

              A screen appears welcoming her. She gets magic mittens from the instructor and puts
              them on. Then she waits a few minutes till the music starts playing and the ride
              starts. The rollercoaster takes off, Maya’s anticipation builds up as she gets her
              first command to look to her left to catch a doughnut. She sees the doughnut and
              sticks her hand to the left to touch the hologram. She touches the hologram doughnut
              with her mittens resulting in her feeling a buzz. She gets thrilled as she gets the
              taste of what she can expect. The app congratulates her on her good job.

              As the roller coaster speeds up, Maya sees the message telling her to enjoy the ride.
              She gets an adrenaline rush all over her body as the Goliath goes down at a fast
              speed. Another screen comes up telling her to put her hands up to catch a cookie. Maya
              puts her hands up and is ready to touch the next hologram. She misses it but has the
              opportunity to catch it again. 3... 2... 1... she touches it and can feel the buzz
              again in her mittens! This continues a few times over till all 10 elements have
              passed. As the ride ends, Maya is sad because the fun part is over.

              The screen turns festive and congratulates Maya on her achievement. She totally forgot
              about the actual gift that her sister got her and is extremely surprised. Maya opens
              it immediately and sees a ticket appear. It's an invitation to her favourite local
              restaurant in the Netherlands, and her sister will be there with her next week. Maya’s
              eyes tear up because she is happy to receive such a thoughtful gift as well that her
              sister will be coming to visit her.

              and finds out that the gift can be saved in a digital toaster which makes her smile.
              Maya notices another function and taps on it. Pictures of her catching the snacks
              appear and she starts laughing. She downloads the photos and sends them to her sister
              thanking her for the experience.
