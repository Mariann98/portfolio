          <h4>Problem: Eliciting anxiety through design</h4>
          <p>
            Anxiety is something a lot of people deal with every day but how to elicit it through
            design in order to benefit the user in the long term.

          <h4>Solution: Alarm clock with a punishment system</h4>
          <p>
            For people with discipline and early waking up problems, our team offers the Alarmio
            app, which helps to wake up quickly and effectively by using the punishment system so
            that the users have strong and constant motivation to get up.

          <h4>Step 1 Emotional Situation</h4>
          <p>
            The emotional situation we chose is "unexpected public performance". We came up with it
            by brainstorming different situations we have been through that made us very emotional.
            After diverging, we started combining the same situations in clusters and converged them
            by removing situations that were not relevant to everyone. This was followed up with dot
            voting which we did twice to come up with the final emotional situation.

          <h4>Step 2 Emotional explorations</h4>
          <p>
            My team chose three emotional explorations which were: Mapping, Soundscape, and Box. For
            each exploration, we had a clear intention which we followed according to our execution
            plan in order to come up with findings and reflect on them.

          <h4>Recommendations</h4>
          <p>
            We recommend the Studio website to be an independent website with its own menu and
            functions from the Rijksmuseum website. With the new menu of the website the key
            functions would be clearly communicated towards the users, which would help them to use
            the website to its fullest potential. <br /><br />Most of our users used the main
            website’s search engine to find functions or artworks. We recommend that only one search
            option should be on the same landing page and that option should search on the studio
            website’s art works and functions. <br /><br />After creating the first set, our users
            didn’t know where to look for it. They tried the main menu, but it didn’t help. Some
            hints while creating the artset about where to find it or a button such as ‘look at the
            artset’ after the creation should help. <br />
            <br />Navigating back to the home page of the Studio website is a long process, since
            the users can only go back page by page. If there would be a home button for the Studio
            website too users could find their way easier.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="work_wrapper_right">
          <p>
            Some links looked like buttons that were used as links in other areas on the website.
            This created confusion for users when they tried to click on them. If there was more
            consistency across the website in how links are designed, then it would create less
            confusion for the user when looking where to click. <br />
            <br />Finding the available routes option can only be seen below some sets or shows up
            randomly among artworks and sets. We recommend having a highlight for these sets on the
            top of the website as a result users will find it easily and start to plan their journey
            to the museum. <br />
            <br />
            There are many options in the refine menu which creates a lot of information to absorb
            for the user. A recommendation would be to select your refinements before you search
            again as the page reloads after every refinement filter. It would also make it more
            efficient to have a ‘remove all’ function to remove the refinements as this is a
            one-at-a-time action.
