              The project explores the significance of emotion in creating an engaging user
              experience through creative research and explorative design. Throughout 1 period my
              team of 4 did several emotional explorations and an emotional installation which
              helped us create a design that elicits chosen emotion and which results in something
              good.

          <h4>Step 1 Emotional Situation</h4>
          <p>
            The emotional situation we chose is "unexpected public performance". We came up with it
            by brainstorming different situations we have been through that made us very emotional.
            After diverging, we started combining the same situations in clusters and converged them
            by removing situations that were not relevant to everyone. This was followed up with dot
            voting which we did twice to come up with the final emotional situation.

          <h4>Step 2 Emotional explorations</h4>
          <p>
            My team chose three emotional explorations which were: Mapping, Soundscape, and Box. For
            each exploration, we had a clear intention which we followed according to our execution
            plan in order to come up with findings and reflect on them.

          <h6>The Mapping</h6>
          <p>
            We started this emotional exploration with the intent to dive deeper into the experience
            of unexpected public speaking and understand the underlying emotions that one feels
            before, during, and after the performance. Another goal of the personal emotional
            exploration was for us to get familiar with emotional granularity, and analyze our
            thoughts, feelings, actions, and bodily responses during the stages of the experience.On
            this graph you can see my situation.

            After the analysis of the emotional mapping, our team decided to focus on one specific
            part of the experience of unexpected public speaking for further exploration. In fact,
            the most curious part of the emotional mapping is the “during the performance” part. We
            discovered our main findings and differences in this particular part and agreed that the
            contrast in emotions is what makes it interesting to explore.

          <p>
            We started our third emotional exploration with the intent to see how people would react
            in two different situations according to their surroundings. With this exploration, we
            also want to show everyone what the environment can do to a person's mind depending on
            what it's reflecting. To make this possible, we will use a black box that is empty which
            will implement the stage fright - there is nothing to worry about but people are still
            afraid of public performance. The first part of our experiment should make the person
            feel exposed and anxious and in the second part, more confident and prepared.

          <h4>Step 3 Exploration Insights & Design Principles before</h4>
          <p>
            After our explorations, we came up with the most important insights and created design
            principles for our emotional installation.
          </p>
          <h6>Insights</h6>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Standing on a stage in front of a group of people causes a physical reaction like
              trembling and sweating that leads to insecurity and lost concentration.
            </li>
            <li>
              The bigger the stage the bigger the anxiety because empty space gives the feeling of
              having no option to hide and save your life in case of attack.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cheering after the performance can make the person feel rewarded and more confident in
              themselves.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h6>Principles</h6>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Physical discomfort occurs when the person is positioned in the middle of a spacious
              place (white, negative space).
            </li>
            <li>
              The anxiety rises when the place is dark and the only light spot is directed at the
              person.
            </li>
            <li>
              Concentration on the physical response (trembling, sweating) leads to its
              amplification.
            </li>
            <li>
              Positive feedback, in the end, makes the user perceive the whole experience as more
              positive.
            </li>
            <li>Cheerful sounds increase self-confidence and give a sense of recognition.</li>
          </ol>

        <div class="work_wrapper_left">
          <h4>Step 4 Emotional Installation</h4>
          <p>
            We started our installation with the intent to see how people would react in the same
            situation but under different circumstances. Each visitor will stand on the chair that
            imitates the stage, have headphones on while watching the same video projected on the
            wall, and have their hands sprayed with water imitating sweat. The beginning and the end
            are the same, so the experience will start with the heart heavily beating and ends with
            applause from the audience. Half of the visitors will listen to a happy song with some
            enthusiastic cheering, the other half will continue listening to the heartbeat along
            with some anxious music.

          <h4>Step 5 Exploration Insights & Design Principles after</h4>
          <p>
            After the emotional installation, we came up with the most important insights and
            created design principles for our iterations.
          </p>
          <h6>Insights</h6>
          <ol>
            <li>
              The emotions of fear, horror and depression lengthen the subjective perception of
              time, while the emotions of joy and carelessness have almost no effect on the
              perception of time.
            </li>
            <li>
              The emotion translated through the sound manipulates our focus of attention and
              interpretation of what we see.
            </li>
            <li>
              Getting appraised after a bad performance confuses people and makes them feel not
              worthy of the award and the approval of the public.
            </li>
            <li>Listening to a positive soundscape makes people more physically active.</li>
          </ol>
          <h6>Principles</h6>
          <ol>
            <li>
              The elevated surface triggers feelings of insecurity and stress (the chair in our
              case).
            </li>
            <li>The tense soundscape evokes the feeling of insecurity.</li>
            <li>
              A tense soundscape makes the participants interpret the situation through negative
              perceptions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Dark and heavy musical accompaniment influences the interpretation of observed events
              as negative.
            </li>
            <li>Positive sound elicits a rise of energy in the body.</li>

          <h4>Step 6 Ideation</h4>
          <p>
            We asked ourselves the question “How can we use anxiety to trigger something good?” and
            started brain dumping. Every team member did this individually. The next step was to
            vote on each other’s ideas and give suggestions for improvement. After that, we came
            together to cluster them and find our favorites. We did this through a discussion
            explaining our preferences and reasons for them. Throughout the process we found
            ourselves mixing guilt and anxiety so we chose the idea that seemed to be the closest to
            anxiety. We continued developing the alarm idea by making a few HMW questions which
            helped us clarify the idea. After three rounds of voting on each HMW, we decided on key
            features that we want to implement in our iteration.

          <h4>Step 7 Iteration 1 and 2</h4>
          <h6>First iteration</h6>
          <p>
            During our iteration, we decided to test the punishment system of the alarm clock. We
            agreed that the strongest ideas are charging money and auto-sending random photos from
            the user’s gallery to random contacts when the user snoozes or ignores the alarm. We
            intend to learn what the users do, think, and say about these features. We will define
            which punishment system causes more anxiety and focus on that in our design.
          </p>
          <h6>Execution</h6>
          <p>
            We have two different ideas to test. Each of us will test the features on one or two
            people. Our target group will be people with discipline problems, who experience real
            problems waking up in the morning, and who own an electric toothbrush. The first idea is
            to test the user by threatening to take their money away if they decide to snooze the
            alarm. We will implement that by calling the user in the early morning and notifying
            them that it’s time to wake up and brush their teeth. To be sure that the user woke we
            will ask to take a picture of them brushing their teeth, in case if they do not send a
            picture 5 minutes after the call they will be charged 5 euros. After this testing, we
            will interview the user to learn about their experience. The second idea is to test the
            user by threatening to upload a compromising picture of them if they decide to snooze
            the alarm. The implementation will be the same with the exception that if they do not
            send a picture within 5 minutes, we will post an embarrassing picture of them on
            Instagram.

          <h6>Second iteration</h6>
          <p>
            For the second iteration we decided to test the modified idea with photo punishment. Our
            goal was to eliminate the blackmailing feeling of the photo punishment but still have it
            as a trigger to wake up quickly. So after a brainstorming session, we came up with the
            idea of photoshopped pictures of a person posted online if they snooze Alarmio. The
            photoshopped image should be embarrassing and awkward enough to motivate the person to
            wake up.
          </p>
          <h6>Execution</h6>
          <p>
            Each of us will test the new improved version of our alarm clock with one person. They
            will have the chance before the testing to take a look at the application to get a
            better understanding of what will happen. During the testing, we will call the user and
            threaten to upload a modified picture of them on Instagram if they decide to snooze
            their alarm. We will implement that by calling the user in the early morning and
            notifying them that it is time to wake up and brush their teeth. This time we won't end
            the call, but instead, let the tester hear a ticking sound and count down every minute
            to build up the anxiety. To be sure that the user woke up we will ask to take a picture
            of them brushing their teeth, in case they do not send a picture within 5 minutes, we
            will post a modified picture of them on Instagram. After this testing, we will interview
            the user to learn about their experience.

          <h4>Step 8 Final emotional design</h4>
          <p>
            The main objective for our final design was to create an alarm clock application that
            will help the users to get up on time by triggering anxiety in them. The user needs to
            sign up for the app by connecting with Instagram and choosing 5 photos that the app is
            allowed to modify. Then the user needs to connect their electric toothbrush through
            Bluetooth which will help the application figure out whether the user is fully up or
            not. During the sign-up process, the user will be given a thorough introduction to how
            the app works. <br /><br />In order to use Alarmio, the alarm needs to be set at the
            desired time of waking up. When it’s time to get up, the alarm goes off (anxiety
            triggering alarm sound) and if the user decides to indeed brush their teeth, the app
            will say “If you don’t brush your teeth within the next 5 minutes, a modified photo of
            you will be posted on Instagram.” The user will see a preview of the possible photo
            being posted, and the timer starts the countdown of 5 minutes making ticking noises. By
            turning on the toothbrush, Alarmio is able to detect that the process has started, and
            counts it finished when the user has been brushing their teeth for 2 minutes (the normal
            amount of time a person should brush their teeth). <br /><br />When the task was
            successfully completed, Alarmio will congratulate the user and show them a streak in
            case the user has woken up several times without snoozing. But if the user decides to
            snooze, the application will say “Here is the last chance to redeem yourself. You have 1
            minute to get up and brush your teeth or a modified photo of you will get posted on
            Instagram.” Alamrio shows a preview of the photo and starts the countdown and ticking
            sound. Then the process is the same if they choose to use their second chance. If they
            don’t, a modified photo will be posted on their Instagram which will be there for 24
            hours without the option to take it down. A descriptive text will be added to the photo,
            to amplify the anxiety even more.

            <h4>Video explaining Alarm.io</h4>
            <p>
              At the end of the Design for Emotion course, each group had to create a 3-minute video
              explaining their project. In total there were 19 videos, and afterward, everyone got
              to vote in four categories: 'Best movie', 'Best acting', 'Best concept', 'Overall
              best'. Our movie did history by winning in three categories out of four. Here you can
              see the award-winning movie:
