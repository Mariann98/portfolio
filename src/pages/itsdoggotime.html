            <h4>How did this idea born?</h4>
            <p>
              It's doggo time is one of my first projects when I first started in the early 2020s. I
              wanted to gain some experience so I made up a project which goal was to create
              something that would benefit my family and me on daily basis.<br /><br />I did some
              brainstorming and also asked my family members what is something that they need.
              During it, my mother arrived at home and started asking about our dachshund Isabella -
              when did she do this and that and how much. This happens every day and after some time
              it got annoying for all of us and then the idea hit me in the face - an app to log our
              dog’s excrement and food data.

            <h4>Low-fi wireframes</h4>
            <p>
              I started doing my research by asking my family and friends what would they expect to
              have in this application. Then I began with low-fidelity wireframes. At first, I
              planned on adding just the excrement data option, but thanks to my research I found
              out that it would be great to have also options to record the dog’s medicine and food
              data.

            <h4>Doggo groups for family members</h4>
            <p>
              This app is very convenient for those who have several pets. For example in my family,
              we have two dogs that need our love and care. This is why I wanted to create an
              environment where there could be separate groups for different dogs. One family member
              can easily create a group for a dog and invite the persons who are involved in taking
              care of the pet to join. This way they can all log the dog’s data whenever something
              comes up. Each person can also take a look at the data to get a clear overview of what
              happened and when.

              or pill element which will save this data by date and time.
