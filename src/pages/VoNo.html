              I had the opportunity to improve the features of the VoNo memo app, where a user can
              collect and send memos in the fastest way. Throughout this project, I did research,
              figured out the improvements needed in the app, and redesigned the homepage.

            <h4>The objective</h4>
            <p>
              The client wanted to improve the UX and UI of the app. I needed to provide the client
              with an updated version of the home screen (which includes the four ‘memo’
              functionalities). The home screen was supposed to be intuitive and reflect the needs
              of the user. The client is ready to remove or add new features to the home screen if
              it improves the User Experience. The user statistics attached below will show the most
              used features.

            <h4>Getting to know the app</h4>
            <p>
              I started my process by discovering the functions of the VoNo app. I wanted to go
              through it without prior knowledge to find out if everything is understandable to the
              user who is new to the app like me. After writing down some notes on what is clear and
              what needs some improvements, I visited the VoNo website. This gave me a clear
              overview of what the application is about. Then I wanted to get to know the customer
              group, so I went through Google Play reviews to find some intel on the product. Before
              I started to prototype, I wanted to make sure I am not biased regarding the
              improvements I would like to make, so I asked my fellow peers to use the app and tell
              me about their experiences. After the testing, I made my final list of improvements to
              the app.

            <h4>List of improvements</h4>
            <p>
              After my research I concluded that the following aspects could be improved: <br />From
              the UI part, I felt that everything looked nice and seemed functional, but I wanted to
              make the icons more consistent and solid in order to improve the app's look. Other
              than that, the client is the king and I work according to their taste preference.<br />
              From the UX perspective I have some improvements:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                The recording starts immediately when opening the app. This can be good or bad. On
                one hand, when for example, driving a car, it is nice to have that functionality,
                but when the user is already finding the time to open it, I think they have time to
                tap the record button too. (Sidenote: the driver should not use the phone anyways
                when driving). During my research, I found out that this functionality is not
                convenient and is disturbing since the user would have to tap on the Discard button
                (+ discard memo) to make it stop.
              </li>
              <li>
                According to the information I received about VoNo, the users use mostly the
                voice-to-text function, so it should be first on the list. As the percentage shows,
                “reminder” and “share” are not as popular, so these should either be removed (and
                used only on the “memo overview” page) or hidden. The user shouldn’t be distracted
                by those features since the main point of this application is to send a memo fast to
                yourself or someone else.
              </li>
              <li>
                I am interested to know what the blue line on top of the screen is for, and for what
                stands the 50/10 number. I understand that the first number decreases because the
                user has 50 memos without the Pro version, but what does the 10 stand for? And I
                guess the blue bar should also increase/decrease depending on the number of memos
                left. (This started working after I had only 10 memos left).
              </li>
              <li>
                When first registering the account, maybe it would be nice to get a pop-up
                indicating that the user has 50 free memos and lead them to the page where they get
                more information about it. 5. I like that there is an option to change the order of
                the “send” and “save” buttons, but they could have a different look, so the user
                could recognize the correct button immediately without thinking and reading.
              </li>
              <li>
                On the “voice” page, the share button does not function when nothing is recorded.
                This could be removed and have it only on the page where the recording has stopped,
                would be enough.
              </li>
              <li>
                It would be more coinvent to have the “memo overview” (or the “folder”) icon on the
                right side of the screen. Firstly, for right-handed people (90% of the world's
                population) it is easier to reach it, but also the 50/10 would be more
                understandable and indicated clearly in the memos.
              </li>
              <li>
                When first opening the app, there is a “Get started” button and usually the user can
                enter their information. Here, however, this step is skipped, and the user is
                immediately in the app. Does this mean, that after I enter my email as a recipient I
                am automatically registered/logged in and in the future can sign in with my Google,
                etc. account? In that case, the “email and password” login does not have a function.
              </li>
              <li>
                On the login page, I cannot go back to the “Get started” page if I accidentally have
                tapped on the "login" button as a first-time user. I would have to uninstall and
                then install the app again.
              </li>
              <li>
                It would be nice to ask the user if they want their first recipient’s email address
                to be the one, they registered with. Usually, the account you register is the
                primary one anyways, and this would make the process faster for the user, instead of
                double asking for their email.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Prototyping</h4>
            <p>
              After figuring out the app’s functions and the core needs for the home page I started
              prototyping. I made a style guide and decided on new icons. I wanted them to be solid
              and consistent throughout the app, so I made a few myself and downloaded the others.
              Then I opened my list of improvements and started working my way down. I am very
              detail-oriented, so everything had to be perfectly centered and sized. I was having
              some trouble deciding whether to leave the “reminder” and “share” functions on the
              home screen or not, since the percetnece of using them is fairly low (4.6 and 0.6).
              But for the sake of older customers, I wanted to leave those options, so the users who
              operate those features, wouldn’t feel sad/mad for their disappearance. I first made
              the new navbar, which looks similar to the older version but with a few improvements,
              like new icons, and different orders. Then I continued with the enabled and disabled
              “send” and “save” buttons and tried to figure out the best way for the user to operate
              with them. Then I continued with the middle part. I used this method for every page.
              After this, I made pop-up pages like “add extra recipient”, “error”, etc. I previously
              pointed out the changes that could be made, but here is the final list of what I
              actually improved. <br /><br />The changes I made:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>New icons – consistency throughout the app.</li>
              <li>
                The “folder/memo overview” and “settings” switched places. More convenient for
                right-handed users, “settings” are not used as often.
              </li>
              <li>
                Numbers above (10/50) show that the user has used 10 out of 50 memos, and the bar
                will increase according to that.
              </li>
              <li>
                Recording doesn’t start automatically anymore, instead the user needs to start it
                themselves.
              </li>
              <li>
                New look to “save” and “send” buttons, so the user can tap on them without further
                thinking.
              </li>
              <li>
                The “discard/cancel” button has been moved down, so the user could easily discard
                the recording, or delete the whole text when typing.
              </li>
              <li>
                I also wanted to delete the calendar and/or share button at least from the main
                page, so they can do it in the memo overview anyways.
              </li>
              <li>
                I decided to leave the “reminder” and “share” options on the home page, but I placed
                them under “options”.
              </li>
              <li>
                The “photo” page has now an option to view the photo taken before sending or saving
                it. It is always good to have the option to check what you are sending, to be sure
                it’s not blurry, for example.
              </li>
            </ol>
