              I had the opportunity to improve the features of the VoNo memo app, where a user can
              collect and send memos in the fastest way. Throughout this project, I did research,
              figured out the improvements needed in the app, and redesigned the homepage.

            <h4>Getting to know the app</h4>
            <p>
              I started my process by discovering the functions of the VoNo app. I wanted to go
              through it without prior knowledge to find out if everything is understandable to the
              user who is new to the app like me. After writing down some notes on what is clear and
              what needs some improvements, I visited the VoNo website. This gave me a clear
              overview of what the application is about. Then I wanted to get to know the customer
              group, so I went through Google Play reviews to find some intel on the product. Before
              I started to prototype, I wanted to make sure I am not biased regarding the
              improvements I would like to make, so I asked my fellow peers to use the app and tell
              me about their experiences. After the testing, I made my final list of improvements to
              the app.
              <br />

            <h4>List of improvements</h4>
            <p>
              After my research I concluded that the following aspects could be improved: <br />From
              the UI part, I felt that everything looked nice and seemed functional, but I wanted to
              make the icons more consistent and solid in order to improve the app's look. Other
              than that, the client is the king and I work according to their taste preference.<br />
              From the UX perspective I have some improvements:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                The recording starts immediately when opening the app. This can be good or bad. On
                one hand, when for example, driving a car, it is nice to have that functionality,
                but when the user is already finding the time to open it, I think they have time to
                tap the record button too. (Sidenote: the driver should not use the phone anyways
                when driving). During my research, I found out that this functionality is not
                convenient and is disturbing since the user would have to tap on the Discard button
                (+ discard memo) to make it stop.
              </li>
              <li>
                According to the information I received about VoNo, the users use mostly the
                voice-to-text function, so it should be first on the list. As the percentage shows,
                “reminder” and “share” are not as popular, so these should either be removed (and
                used only on the “memo overview” page) or hidden. The user shouldn’t be distracted
                by those features since the main point of this application is to send a memo fast to
                yourself or someone else.
              </li>
              <li>
                I am interested to know what the blue line on top of the screen is for, and for what
                stands the 50/10 number. I understand that the first number decreases because the
                user has 50 memos without the Pro version, but what does the 10 stand for? And I
                guess the blue bar should also increase/decrease depending on the number of memos
                left. (This started working after I had only 10 memos left).
              </li>
              <li>
                When first registering the account, maybe it would be nice to get a pop-up
                indicating that the user has 50 free memos and lead them to the page where they get
                more information about it. 5. I like that there is an option to change the order of
                the “send” and “save” buttons, but they could have a different look, so the user
                could recognize the correct button immediately without thinking and reading.
              </li>
              <li>
                On the “voice” page, the share button does not function when nothing is recorded.
                This could be removed and have it only on the page where the recording has stopped,
                would be enough.
              </li>
              <li>
                It would be more coinvent to have the “memo overview” (or the “folder”) icon on the
                right side of the screen. Firstly, for right-handed people (90% of the world's
                population) it is easier to reach it, but also the 50/10 would be more
                understandable and indicated clearly in the memos.
              </li>
              <li>
                When first opening the app, there is a “Get started” button and usually the user can
                enter their information. Here, however, this step is skipped, and the user is
                immediately in the app. Does this mean, that after I enter my email as a recipient I
                am automatically registered/logged in and in the future can sign in with my Google,
                etc. account? In that case, the “email and password” login does not have a function.
              </li>
              <li>
                On the login page, I cannot go back to the “Get started” page if I accidentally have
                tapped on the "login" button as a first-time user. I would have to uninstall and
                then install the app again.
              </li>
              <li>
                It would be nice to ask the user if they want their first recipient’s email address
                to be the one, they registered with. Usually, the account you register is the
                primary one anyways, and this would make the process faster for the user, instead of
                double asking for their email.

            <h4>Step 3 Hierarchical Task Diagrams</h4>
            <p>
              Our group made four hierarchical task diagrams that describe four main tasks that were
              filtered from the steps taken before.

            Buying tickets is the general functionality of the cinema website. This Hierarchical
            Task Diagram illustrates the step-by-step process of buying the tickets from the moment
            a user lands on the website to the moment of getting tickets.

            Voting for the upcoming international movie week is one of the main special features of
            the Bios website. This Hierarchical Task Diagram illustrates the process of voting for
            the country the user wants to be in on international movie week. The process is starting
            on the home page and ends on the voting form.

            Creating an account allows the user to buy tickets faster and easier. It is also one of
            the general functions of the website. This Hierarchical Task Diagram shows the creating
            account process where the user can enter their country of origin in order to receive
            information about upcoming international movie weeks.

            Pre-ordering snacks is a special option for the international movie week. The user can
            choose the snacks that are made exclusively for the international week, considering the
            culture and cuisine of the country that’s currently on the international week. This
            Hierarchical Task Diagram illustrates how the user can pre-order their snacks while
            purchasing a ticket to an international movie.

            <h4>Value proposition</h4>
            <p>
              For digital natives, BIOS cinema offers international movies that give the
              internationals a chance to see a movie from different countries, including their own
              by screening foreign films every first week of the month so they feel a sense of
              intercultural inclusiveness in a foreign country. This idea originated from our
              client’s wish of being inclusive toward people with different cultural backgrounds
              since roughly 20% of the Netherlands population is international. For this reason,
              BIOS cinema will stand out, by having a community where internationals are accepted
              and included. Also, natives who are curious can explore more cultural backgrounds and
              differences.

            <h4>Scenarios and Requirements</h4>
            <p>
              In week 4, my group had to create two different types of scenarios: 1) Concrete
              scenario and 2) Use Case Description. These helped us evaluate our concept, describe
              concrete requirements, explore possible features, and include ideas about the
              interface. After gathering user needs and performing the first ideation session, it
              was time to assemble requirements that our intended interactive products should do to
              satisfy user needs and business requirements. For creating those we used the “Moscow”
              method. This followed up with card-sorting in week 5 and analyzing the results by
              creating a taxonomy method.

            <h4>Step 7 Flowchart</h4>
            <p>
              The flowchart illustrates the sequence of actions to book a ticket for the French
              movie from the International Movie Week. The flowcharts start from the home page,
              where the user clicks on the banner with French Movie Week. From that page, the user
              clicks on the specific French movie and goes through the booking process, by selecting
              the location of the cinema and showtime. Before the user proceeds with the booking,
              the system asks the user to log in (with several options) or continue as a guest. When
              the user completes the booking the system asks them to pay and suggests different
              payment methods. The flowchart ends when the user receives the tickets in their email.

              The site map illustrated the structure of the Bios cinema website. There are two menus
              on the home page: the main menu and the secondary menu. The main menu consists of the
              popular functionalities that the regular user is looking for on the website. Whereas
              the secondary menu has information for those who are interested in the Bios vacancies
              or would like to read the privacy statement. Even though the classic site map has only
              pages, our team decided to showcase other elements of the website as links, filters,
              important buttons, and so on. We defined the type of element with the color.
