              During this project for 'Interaction Design' course, my team of 4 learned to translate
              user needs into system requirements and design an information structure that fits
              these requirements and facilitates a fluent user-system interaction.

            UK Cinemas plans to launch a new digital platform for the Dutch cinema chain Bios, which
            already has over 30 successful cinemas, but no history with Dutch clients.

            <h4>Step 1 Design Brief</h4>
            <p>
              The client is UK Cinemas which is a large cinema chain operating in the UK. They
              obtained Dutch cinema chain Bios to enter the Dutch market. They have a reputation for
              having big and successful openings with each of their cinemas. They are well known for
              their passion for every detail to be on point and also a love of having cinemas
              inclusive for everyone.<br />
              <br />
              UK Cinemas plans to launch a new digital platform for the Dutch cinema chain Bios,
              which already has over 30 successful cinemas, but no history with Dutch clients. Even
              though it will be his first time working with a Dutch audience, our client still wants
              to keep bringing that success into the opening of the Bios chain too. He defines his
              success by the number of people on the opening night, almost always selling out, and
              after that just by the number of people visiting the cinema daily. The Dutch market
              for digital presence for cinemas is much more mature since a lot more people over the
              age of 30 also enjoy going to the cinemas here, so movies that follow more mature and
              serious matters are also more popular. Therefore UK Cinemas’ success cannot be simply
              copied to the Dutch market because the matter of a more mature audience has to be
              treated carefully. So our job will be to develop the design of the website for the
              rebranding of the Bios cinema in order to match the Dutch market. <br /><br />
              According to the customer research the target audience is considered to be between 16
              and 26 years old and is so-called “digital natives” meaning they expect the best
              online experience.<br /><br />

            <h4>User stories</h4>
            <p>
              Throughout this course, we had to weekly update our user stories list for which we
              used this format: As a user, I want to < goal/desire > so that < benefit >. Along with
              this, we included motivation and argumentation.<br /><br />
              In week 2, we created a storyboard, which describes the story of visiting the Bios
              cinema from the idea of going out to the moment when the user is enjoying the movie.
              This storyboard helped us to see the website in the context of use and spot some
              relevant functionalities that need to be in the website. It illustrates the relation
              between use cases (buying a ticket, pre-ordering snacks) and actors (private
              customers).

            <h4>Step 3 Hierarchical Task Diagrams</h4>
            <p>
              Our group made four hierarchical task diagrams that describe four main tasks that were
              filtered from the steps taken before.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            Buying tickets is the general functionality of the cinema website. This Hierarchical
            Task Diagram illustrates the step-by-step process of buying the tickets from the moment
            a user lands on the website to the moment of getting tickets.

          <div class="work_wrapper_right">

          </div>

          <p>
            Voting for the upcoming international movie week is one of the main special features of
            the Bios website. This Hierarchical Task Diagram illustrates the process of voting for
            the country the user wants to be in on international movie week. The process is starting
            on the home page and ends on the voting form.

          </div>
          <p>
            Creating an account allows the user to buy tickets faster and easier. It is also one of
            the general functions of the website. This Hierarchical Task Diagram shows the creating
            account process where the user can enter their country of origin in order to receive
            information about upcoming international movie weeks.

          </div>

          <p>
            Pre-ordering snacks is a special option for the international movie week. The user can
            choose the snacks that are made exclusively for the international week, considering the
            culture and cuisine of the country that’s currently on the international week. This
            Hierarchical Task Diagram illustrates how the user can pre-order their snacks while
            purchasing a ticket to an international movie.

            <h4>Step 4 HMW-questions</h4>
            <p>
              In week 3, we had to come up with three How Might We questions based on our user
              stories. This followed with 6-3-5 brainwriting and affinity diagram.<br /><br />
            </p>
            <p>1. How might we make the website inclusive of international users?</p>
            <div class="work_wrapper_right">
              <img src="../../public/pictures/id5.jpg" class="pictures" alt="mockup" />
            </div>
            <p>
              2. How might we make browsing the upcoming/ongoing movies more entertaining for the
              user?
            </p>
            <div class="work_wrapper_right">
              <img src="../../public/pictures/id6.jpg" class="pictures" alt="mockup" />
            </div>
            <p>3. How might we make the users be more incentivized to create an account?</p>
            <div class="work_wrapper_right">
              <img src="../../public/pictures/id7.jpg" class="pictures" alt="mockup" />
            </div>
            <p>We ended up with three main ideas:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <b>International movie week</b>.<br />The main focus of the website is to be
                culturally inclusive. That is why we have chosen to work on an intercultural movie
                week block of functionalities.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Pre-ordering snacks during the movie week</b>.<br />In the cinema, there will be
                a special snack menu depending on the cultural cuisine of the country that is on
                international movie week. Preordering intercultural snacks, first of all, support
                the ideology of inclusiveness of the Bios cinema, and secondly saves time for the
                customers. It also increases snack sales, which is beneficial from a business point
                of view.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Voting for the next country on the international movie week </b>.<br />This
                function gives the users a sense of being a part of the movie community and the
                power to influence the following international movie weeks.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Value proposition</h4>
            <p>
              For digital natives, BIOS cinema offers international movies that give the
              internationals a chance to see a movie from different countries, including their own
              by screening foreign films every first week of the month so they feel a sense of
              intercultural inclusiveness in a foreign country. This idea originated from our
              client’s wish of being inclusive toward people with different cultural backgrounds
              since roughly 20% of the Netherlands population is international. For this reason,
              BIOS cinema will stand out, by having a community where internationals are accepted
              and included. Also, natives who are curious can explore more cultural backgrounds and
              differences.

            <h4>Scenarios and Requirements</h4>
            <p>
              In week 4, my group had to create two different types of scenarios: 1) Concrete
              scenario and 2) Use Case Description. These helped us evaluate our concept, describe
              concrete requirements, explore possible features, and include ideas about the
              interface. After gathering user needs and performing the first ideation session, it
              was time to assemble requirements that our intended interactive products should do to
              satisfy user needs and business requirements. For creating those we used the “Moscow”
              method. This followed up with card-sorting in week 5 and analyzing the results by
              creating a taxonomy method.

            <h4>Step 7 Flowchart</h4>
            <p>
              The flowchart illustrates the sequence of actions to book a ticket for the French
              movie from the International Movie Week. The flowcharts start from the home page,
              where the user clicks on the banner with French Movie Week. From that page, the user
              clicks on the specific French movie and goes through the booking process, by selecting
              the location of the cinema and showtime. Before the user proceeds with the booking,
              the system asks the user to log in (with several options) or continue as a guest. When
              the user completes the booking the system asks them to pay and suggests different
              payment methods. The flowchart ends when the user receives the tickets in their email.

              The site map illustrated the structure of the Bios cinema website. There are two menus

              popular functionalities that the regular user is looking for on the website. Whereas
              the secondary menu has information for those who are interested in the Bios vacancies
              or would like to read the privacy statement. Even though the classic site map has only
              pages, our team decided to showcase other elements of the website as links, filters,
              important buttons, and so on. We defined the type of element with the color.
