              During this project for 'Research for Design' course, my team of 4 analyzed the
              website of Rijksstudio. Our goal was to make the users’ experience better through
              research, which includes user trialing. For the success of this research, we had to
              figure out as a team the main usability problems by conducting user trialing and
              analyzing the results. The Rijksmuseum is a Dutch National museum dedicated to arts
              and history in Amsterdam. The Rijksstudio site is a platform developed by the
              Rijksmuseum to share art collections free of charge with the public in high quality
              that brings the Rijksmuseum to your home.

            <h4>Problem: Reporting user's issues</h4>
            <p>
              Visitors of the Rijksstudio website face usability problems that need to be
              investigated.

            <h4>The process</h4>
            <p>
              The user trial started by exploring the website as a team and noting the various
              features of the website. After that we came up with the research questions, target
              audience, and set-up. My team developed seven different tasks that users must perform,
              which showed us the most common issues. We conducted a pilot-test to ensure that we
              were ready and that we could avoid some of the problems what might occur. Following
              the user trial, we began to analyze our data, found some interesting insights and made
              recommendations to create a better user experience.

            <h4>User profile</h4>
            <p>
              The user profile we chose was “young (18-30 years old) art enthusiast”. Those are the
              people who have a general interest in classical arts and visit museums at least twice
              a year. We chose this user group as we believe the Rijksmuseum is targeting them
              through their Studio webpage to inspire them with the available art and as
              Gen-Z/Millennials they are proactive users of online content

            <h4>Recommendations</h4>
            <p>
              We recommend the Studio website to be an independent website with its own menu and
              functions from the Rijksmuseum website. With the new menu of the website the key
              functions would be clearly communicated towards the users, which would help them to
              use the website to its fullest potential. <br /><br />Most of our users used the main
              website’s search engine to find functions or artworks. We recommend that only one
              search option should be on the same landing page and that option should search on the
              studio website’s art works and functions. <br /><br />After creating the first set,
              our users didn’t know where to look for it. They tried the main menu, but it didn’t
              help. Some hints while creating the artset about where to find it or a button such as
              ‘look at the artset’ after the creation should help. <br />
              <br />Navigating back to the home page of the Studio website is a long process, since
              the users can only go back page by page. If there would be a home button for the
              Studio website too users could find their way easier.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="work_wrapper_right">
            <p>
              Some links looked like buttons that were used as links in other areas on the website.
              This created confusion for users when they tried to click on them. If there was more
              consistency across the website in how links are designed, then it would create less
              confusion for the user when looking where to click. <br />
              <br />Finding the available routes option can only be seen below some sets or shows up
              randomly among artworks and sets. We recommend having a highlight for these sets on
              the top of the website as a result users will find it easily and start to plan their
              journey to the museum. <br />
              <br />
              There are many options in the refine menu which creates a lot of information to absorb
              for the user. A recommendation would be to select your refinements before you search
              again as the page reloads after every refinement filter. It would also make it more
              efficient to have a ‘remove all’ function to remove the refinements as this is a
              one-at-a-time action.
