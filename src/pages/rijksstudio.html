              During this project for 'Research for Design' course, my team of 4 analyzed the
              website of Rijksstudio. Our goal was to make the users’ experience better through
              research, which includes user trialing. For the success of this research, we had to
              figure out as a team the main usability problems by conducting user trialing and
              analyzing the results. The Rijksmuseum is a Dutch National museum dedicated to arts
              and history in Amsterdam. The Rijksstudio site is a platform developed by the
              Rijksmuseum to share art collections free of charge with the public in high quality
              that brings the Rijksmuseum to your home.

              The user trial started by exploring the website as a team and noting the various
              features of the website. After that we created the site map and came up with the

            <h4>Step 2 Research set-up</h4>
            <p>
              During the trial, we used Zoom to capture the user's actions, sounds, and their facial
              expressions. Using Zoom was the most convenient way to do all three recordings at the
              same time. The user profile we chose was “young (18-30 years old) art enthusiast”.
              Those are the people who have a general interest in classical arts and visit museums
              at least twice a year. We chose this user group as we believe the Rijksmuseum is
              targeting them through their Studio webpage to inspire them with the available art and
              as Gen-Z/Millennials they are proactive users of online content. Each group member had
              to interview one participant and do the user-trialing with. This profile helped us
              find out what they, as art lovers actually do and find on the webpage, what kind of
              problems they might have and how they could plan their in-person visits to the museum.

              After the user trialling, each of us did a transcript of the interview and the video
              recording, which helped us create flowcharts in XD to have an overview of the users
              actions and emotions. Afterward we used the no creativity method to get an overview of
              the usability problems the participants faced.

            Our first task for our participants was to explore it freely, so this really gives an
            overview of how they use the website on their own. The participants visited the gift
            shop, clicked on “Watch our stories” and “What’s on”. Checked out exhibitions and even
            watched a video.

            >
            During the trialling we noticed several usability problems which the user's were facing.
            The different functions as the route option or adding different art works to a set are
            not clearly communicated towards the user. The route option can only be seen below some
            sets and randomly appears among the artworks. Since the user doesn’t know about the set
            option and tries to add something to it, it gets confusing for the user where to add it
            exactly. The user was struggling with finding the correct search engine several times,
            which made it difficult to find the specific artworks on task 4.

            >
            The visitors are incentivized with the website by viewing, creating, and sharing custom
            galleries of artworks put together by other users, picked from the large catalog. They
            can create an account, add artworks in their personal gallery, view others’ galleries,
            or view online tours and galleries made by the people from the museum. They have the
            option to ‘like’ the artwork, download a png, share it, and cycle through the gallery.
            Also, there are engaging headers that invite the users to “Watch our stories” or “Shop
            the collection”.

            <b>4. How do users find information and art pieces on the studio website?</b>
            In case of finding information or art pieces, the user tends to use the Rijksmuseum main
            search engine instead of “Search in Rijksstudio”. This causes confusion for the visitor
            or Rijksstudio due to unnecessary information that occurs by using it. For example the
            user’s were having trouble finding specific artworks for task 4, due to using the main
            search engine. This made the process a lot longer.

            <h4>Step 4 Results and conclusion</h4>
            <p>
              We recommend the Studio website to be an independent website with its own menu and
              functions from the Rijksmuseum website. With the new menu of the website the key
              functions would be clearly communicated towards the users, which would help them to
              use the website to its fullest potential. <br /><br />Most of our users used the main
              website’s search engine to find functions or artworks. We recommend that only one
              search option should be on the same landing page and that option should search on the
              studio website’s art works and functions. <br /><br />After creating the first set,
              our users didn’t know where to look for it. They tried the main menu, but it didn’t
              help. Some hints while creating the artset about where to find it or a button such as
              ‘look at the artset’ after the creation should help. <br />
              <br />Navigating back to the home page of the Studio website is a long process, since
              the users can only go back page by page. If there would be a home button for the
              Studio website too users could find their way easier. <br /><br />

              Some links looked like buttons that were used as links in other areas on the website.
              This created confusion for users when they tried to click on them. If there was more
              consistency across the website in how links are designed, then it would create less
              confusion for the user when looking where to click. <br />
              <br />Finding the available routes option can only be seen below some sets or shows up
              randomly among artworks and sets. We recommend having a highlight for these sets on
              the top of the website as a result users will find it easily and start to plan their
              journey to the museum. <br />
              <br />
              There are many options in the refine menu which creates a lot of information to absorb
              for the user. A recommendation would be to select your refinements before you search
              again as the page reloads after every refinement filter. It would also make it more
              efficient to have a ‘remove all’ function to remove the refinements as this is a
              one-at-a-time action.
